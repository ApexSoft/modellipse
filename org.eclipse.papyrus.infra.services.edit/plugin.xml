<!-- Binds general (non-UML specific) advices

     The notation dependant advice add a View deletion command for any View that references
     the EObject currently destroyed.
     
     Both the following advices are commonly used by GMF Runtime (and code generated by the tooling):
     - org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.core.advice.notationDepdendents
     - org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.core.advice.removeBookmarks
     
     The cross referencer is used to find any View referencing and EObject, as far as the Notation file 
     is loaded (does not mean each diagram is opened), every view related to an element will be deleted
     with the element deletion. These views may possibly be located in different diagrams.
     
     These advices are generally always added to the GMF default context. As the use of the extensible 
     type framework in Papyrus is currently used with an explicit unique context, it is important 
     to add these advices to this shared context to ensure the views are correctly deleted.
